> **Skills, Agents, Commands, and Workflows for Modern UI/UX Development with Claude Code**

Stop getting the same outdated, Bootstrap-era designs. This repository provides a comprehensive, layered approach to dramatically improve the UI/UX components Claude Code generates for your projects.

---

## The New Programming Paradigm

In December 2025, Andrej Karpathy observed that programming is being "dramatically refactored":

> *"I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored."*
>
> *"New vocabulary: agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations..."*

He described Claude Code as *"the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like"* - a "little spirit/ghost that lives on your computer."

**LibreUIUX provides the skills, agents, commands, and workflows for this new paradigm - focused on UI/UX development.**

### Where LibreUIUX Fits

| New Stack Component | LibreUIUX Provides |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Skills** | 74 specialized skills (accessibility, animation, design systems, etc.) |
| **Agents** | 152 task-specific agents (UI validator, design critic, responsive checker, etc.) |
| **Commands** | 76 slash commands for common UI/UX workflows |
| **Plugins** | 70 domain plugins (frontend, accessibility, design mastery, etc.) |
| **Workflows** | Beginner to advanced learning paths |

This isn't just a prompt library. It's infrastructure for the new way we build software with AI.

## The Problem

Developers using Claude Code face these challenges:

- **Repetitive Designs**: Claude generates similar-looking components regardless of project context
- **Outdated Aesthetics**: Components resemble old Bootstrap-era designs (2015-2018)
- **Poor Responsiveness**: Generated layouts don't adapt well to different screen sizes
- **Generic Feel**: Lack of modern design patterns, animations, and interactions
- **Inconsistent Results**: Same prompts produce varying quality across sessions

### Real Developer Experiences

> *"No matter what I try, the UI components generated with Claude Code look outdated. They often resemble older Bootstrap-era designs and are not responsive."*

> *"I've tried custom commands, design agents, detailed prompting, even Claude Opus... nothing consistently works."*

**The core issue**: Claude Code needs specific, structured guidance to generate modern UI/UX.

📝 **Field Notes from the Trenches**

I spent two weeks fighting this. "Make it modern." "Use better colors." "Improve the spacing." Every request felt like rolling dice.

Then I tried: "Create a button with bg-blue-600, hover:bg-blue-700, px-6 py-3, rounded-lg, shadow-md."

Perfect. First try. Every time.

**Here's what clicked:** Claude understands design systems perfectly—Tailwind's scale, spacing units, color tokens. When you speak that precise language instead of vague aesthetics, you're giving coordinates instead of directions.

**Try this:** Compare "make it look better" vs "change shadow-md to shadow-lg and p-4 to p-6"

**Watch for:** The second request gives you exactly what you want, immediately.

**This works because:** You're leveraging Claude's systematic understanding instead of fighting it. That's what this entire repository teaches—the elegant mechanics of communicating design intent precisely.

### Week 2: Systems Thinking
1. Choose a [design system template](./intermediate/design-systems/)
2. Create a CLAUDE.md file for your project
3. Practice the [iteration workflow](./intermediate/workflows/iteration-workflow.md)

### Week 3+: Advanced Techniques
1. Set up [Chrome DevTools MCP](./advanced/mcp-servers/chrome-devtools/)
2. Install [custom slash commands](./advanced/slash-commands/)
3. Build your own component library

## 🔑 Key Principles

Think of these as the elegant mechanics of communicating with Claude. Each principle solves a specific problem in how AI interprets design intent.

### ✅ Do This
- **Be specific**: "glassmorphism card with backdrop-blur-md, subtle border, 12px padding"
  - *Why it works:* Precision eliminates ambiguity. Claude executes specifications, not aesthetics.

- **Reference examples**: "Like the pricing card on https://ui.shadcn.com"
  - *Why it works:* Concrete references create shared understanding instantly.

- **Use design systems**: Define colors, spacing, typography upfront
  - *Why it works:* Systems are languages. Speak once, benefit everywhere.

- **Iterate with context**: Use browser inspector to show exact issues
  - *Why it works:* "Change shadow-md to shadow-xl" beats "make it pop" every time.

- **Think mobile-first**: Always specify responsive behavior
  - *Why it works:* Mobile constraints force clarity. Clarity scales up beautifully.

### ❌ Don't Do This
- ~~"Make it look modern"~~ - No shared definition of "modern"
- ~~"Improve the design"~~ - Improvement in which dimension? Contrast? Spacing? Hierarchy?
- ~~"Make it sleek and beautiful"~~ - Aesthetics are subjective, specifications aren't
- ~~Starting without a design system~~ - Every request becomes a negotiation
- ~~Accepting first output without iteration~~ - Quality emerges through refinement

---

💛 **Gold Hat Note**
Topic: Systematic Communication

This isn't just about getting better UI from Claude. It's about all of us raising collective understanding of how to communicate design intent to AI systems.

When you discover a phrasing that works perfectly, share it in discussions. When you find a design pattern that Claude executes flawlessly, document it. When you notice responsive breakpoint strategies that consistently work, tell the community.

Your breakthrough today becomes someone else's breakthrough tomorrow. Share what you discover. Document your insights. Help others see the patterns.

The craft grows when knowledge flows.

**Before**: Generic Bootstrap table with blue buttons
**After**: Modern data table with shadcn/ui, smooth animations, glassmorphism
**Key**: Used design system template + specific component references
📁 [See full case study](./intermediate/examples/saas-dashboard/)

### Case Study 2: E-commerce Product Page
**Before**: Basic grid layout, no visual hierarchy

Topic: Community Knowledge Building

Every contribution here isn't just helping individual developers—it's mapping the territory of human-AI collaboration in design.

When you share a discovery, you're not just solving your problem. You're potentially unlocking dozens of projects, teaching hundreds of developers, and advancing our collective craft.

That prompt template you perfected? Someone will use it to ship their startup.
That design pattern you documented? A student will learn from it.
That mechanism you explained? It'll spark someone else's breakthrough.

Share generously. Document clearly. Explain thoroughly.

The craft grows when knowledge flows.

## Attribution & Inspiration

The framing of this repository was inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's](https://karpathy.ai/) observations about the transformation of programming in the AI era:

**Key Sources:**
- [LLMs as a New Computing Platform (2025 Year in Review)](https://karpathy.ai/blog/2025-llm-os.html) - Karpathy's comprehensive analysis of how LLMs are becoming a new computing paradigm
- [X/Twitter Thread on the New Vocabulary](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1872411236358504787) - The December 2025 post describing "agents, subagents, prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows"

**On Claude Code specifically:**
> *"Claude Code is the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like... a little spirit/ghost that lives on your computer, can inspect files, use a browser, can be told to 'just fix all the build errors', or 'write tests for this file'."*

This repository aims to provide the specialized UI/UX infrastructure - skills, agents, commands, and workflows - that Karpathy describes as the new developer toolkit.

**Built by developers, for developers. Building the new programming paradigm, one component at a time.**
